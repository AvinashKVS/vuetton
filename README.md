## Usage

* Import the Vuetton component from node_modules.

```js
import Vuetton from 'vuetton';
```
* Use in your template
```vue
<Vuetton size="lg" type="button" text="lg" :action="fetchTasks">Fetch</Vuetton>
```

### Size variations

`lg` - Large
`md` - Medium (default)
`sm` - Small
`xs` - Extra small

### Customization via CSS

Any custom class can be attached to the button through `custom-class` prop

```vue
<Vuetton size="lg" type="button" text="lg" :action="fetchTasks" custom-class="bg--red text--white">Fetch</Vuetton>
```

### Asynchronous support

Component supports asynchronous methods during which button would remain disabled till the function completes its execution.

Keeping the prop `async="true"` will make sure button remains disabled during the function provided in onclick listener.

To add the text during async call, pass the prop `loader-text`.

To change the default loader image, pass the prop `loader-image` which must be an image path.

```vue
<Vuetton size="md" text="Fetch" :async="true" :action="fetchTasks" loader-text="Loading..."></Vuetton>
```

### Type

You can specify the type of button via type prop be it, `button`, `reset`, `submit`. `type="button"` will be the default behaviour if not provided.
